1. Compile c++ library

This library contains the mbCO2 and mbCO2AR 
potential energy functions. To compile the 
shared libraries all you need to do is type 
the following command:

	make 

This will build the libmbCO2.so and 
libmbCO2AR.so shared libraries. These can be 
used in the NITROGEN program to compute the 
vibrational properties and stationary states
of the CO2 and CO2-Ar complexes.
